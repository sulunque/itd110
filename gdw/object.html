<br>For this life, I cannot change</br>
Hidden Hills, deep off in the main</br>
M&M's, sweet like candy cane</br>
Drop the top, pop it, let it bang (pop it, pop it)
F</br>

Drop the top, pop it, let it bang (pop it, pop it)</br>
<p> </p>
Drop the top, play hide and seek</br>
Jump inside, jump straight to the lake</br>
Take a sip, feel just how I be (it's lit!)</br>
On freeway, but no, ain't nothin' free (straight up)</br>
Bend laws, bend lanes</br>
Been bustin' bills, but still ain't nothin' change</br>
You in the mob soon as you rock the chain</br>
She caught the waves just thumbin' through my braids (alright)</br>
Heatin' up, baby, I'm just heatin' up (it's lit)</br>
Need ya love, not a need it is a must (yeah!)</br>
Feelin' stuck, you know how to keep me up (yeah, yeah!)</br>
Icy love, icy like a hockey puck</br>
<p> </p>

All the ones, all the chains piled on the mantle</br>
All the dogs, all the dogs low creep right behind me in the Phantom</br>
Never go, never go dip on the set, stayed Santana</br>
Yeah, run it back, turn the lights on when I hit up Green Lantern</br>
Yeah, fly the broads, fly the dogs down to Atlanta</br>
Yeah, in the cut in Medusa, lay low I might be</br>
Yeah, roll up, help me calm down when I move in high speed</br>
Yeah, If I send one, need the text back 'cause you know what I need</br>
Oh, please (oh please)</br>
Oh me (oh me)</br>
Oh my (oh my)</br>
We been movin', we been movin' for some time (Alright!)</br>
Flexin', flexin' try to exercise</br>
(Exercise, exercise, exercise, exercise)</br>
